# Clusterization of Pearson diagrams for beam-plasma interaction PIC simulations

**Problem**: to automatically and quickly sort a set of diagrams into several groups

Pearson diagrams are obtained from the results of numerical simulations of electron beam propagation through magnetized homogeneous/non-homogeneous plasmas with different parameters. For more details see in *Annenkov et al. sent to **A&A***

The example of a diargam is below.
